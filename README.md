Refactoring an existing webpage of a marketing agency by making many small changes to make it more accessible and without altering the codeâ€™s external behaviour. I have reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

I have created the codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimised for search engine. 

I have learned
-	How to make HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages.
-	The logical structure of HTML elements
-	How to use accessible alt attributes for images and icon elements which provides alternative information for an image or icon if a user for some reason cannot view it
-	How to set heading attributes in a sequential order so that it makes it easier for someone using a screen reader to understand the content.
